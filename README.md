A Firefox extension that allows you to open an arbitrary number of tabs pointing to n URL (most likely a certain GPU company's store), with a certain time delay between tabs. It automatically selects the first tab to load.

## How to use
1. (If not already installed) Install [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
2. Enable Container Tabs (Menu > Settings > General > Tabs)
3. Download extension from [releases page](../../releases) (zip file)
4. Install extension as temporary add-on
    1. Go to Menu > Addons and Themes > Settings Icon > Debug Add-ons
    2. Load Temporary Add-on...
    3. Select previously downloaded zip file and confirm
5. Click on extension logo in the toolbar (<img src="icons/icon.png" alt="extension logo" width="16">), configure and click "Run"
6. Tabs will start to open. The first tab to enter the wanted URL will be selected and, if still possible, no more tabs will be opened.
